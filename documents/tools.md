# Tools
The MDD base repo assumes the following tooling is available:  

Cisco Modeling Labs  
Cisco NSO  
GitLab  

If you do not have the necessary tooling in place, you can use this guide to help deploy what you need.  
Using DevOps to manage your network is not dependent on these specefic tools, but to implement our CI/CD Pipeline  
with your existing environment, these tools do need to be in place. Once you deploy the initial pipeline, you can  
easily change tooling.
